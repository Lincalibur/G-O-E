#Meet Criteria has the user taken to a new GUI, that will allow the user to fill in values in textBoxes
#These will be next to eachother in the format:
#Column name: ___________ looking for ____________
#Button __Add__

#When Button is pressed then the a new line/condition will be added to the list and the user will be able to add multiple conditions.
#The Conditions will be listed below in a textbox for the user to see before they can select the "Save" button.
#The Save Button will create a text file that will be deleted after the entire process is complete.
#The saved text file will contain the Conditions and the conditions must be able to take (<>, >,<,=,>=,<=,|) as well as appropriate values.

# The process will then take the Criteria on the Text file and make a new sheet for each criteria within one excel sheet.
# The Process will then execute the Criteria as filters on the appropriate columns for each sheet.
# Once the Entire process is complete everything is saved in one excel file called "applied_criteria"
